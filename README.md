# MontageAgent
Automates sorting, de-duplication, quality filtering, categorization, captioning, hashtagging, and Instagram publishing for Montage’s event photos.  Uses a LoRA-finetuned BLIP-2 captioner, CLIP-based selection, and a multi-agent (Planner–Executor with Supervisor/Critic) orchestration.
